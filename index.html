                            It's easy to me to teach other people if I understand the topic. People always mention
                            that I can explain everything and everyone will easily understand It.

                            I have been working for two years in a company that distributes industrial automation  
                            components(IAC), my job is to program controllers, programmable terminals(PT) and other  
                            IAC using an IEC 61131-3 standard. When I am entrusted with a project to develop UX+UI  
                            for PT I put my heart and soul at first into usability and then into design, combining  
                            colors, fonts, indents in the design so that the user has a good impression of using  
                            the equipment we distribute. I do this because I believe it increases company's lead  
                            to compete at the industry market. For half a year, I regularly worked on site layout  
                            based on videos from the YouTube channel WAY UP, and had good success. But then I needed  
                            to find a distribution at which I would work after university graduation, and I am very  
                            sorry now that I did not get to work as a layout designer for invaluable experience and
