                        <p>
                            I like to ride a bike in picturesque places, I love mountains, forests and outdoor recreation.<br>
                            I play the guitar and sing, shoot and edit videos (check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX2_R4v5KSJse27QDqfsEHg" title="Pavel Piashcherau Official YouTube Channel">YouTube channel</a>). <br>
                            In 2019, I participated in the filming of the amateur film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGX2dDqRMsE" title="Good Old Times Trailer">"Good Old Times"</a><br>
                            as a director and cameraman, I have an idea of how to shoot well :)<br>
                            Since 2017 for 2019 I took part in "Minsk Half Marathon"; In 2017, I ran only 5.5 km, but every year I increased this distance, so in 2019 I was able to run 21.5 kilometers. <br>
                            The main experience was the pleasure of running through the beautiful places of the city, accompanied by the support of the spectators-fans of the half marathon.<br>
                            The management of the company considers me as a leader, as I take the initiative to organize cultural and mass entertainment events in the office and everything that other colleagues do not want to do,
                            I will hear everyone who needs help and come to rescue them anytime.<br>
                            <br>
                            I also have a category B driver's license (üöó,üöö) with a couple of months of experience, driving a service Skoda Rapid carefully.<br>
                            I have a III (third) group in electrical safety, but soon I will study for the IV (fourth) group in order to become responsible for electrical facilities in my organization (the organization has electrical installations up to 1000 volts on its balance sheet).<br>
                            <br>
                            I want to become a worthy <i>developer-aka-mentor</i> in a good team, I'm good at communication,
                            attentive to what others say, always offer my point of view if I have something to say.
                            It's easy to me to teach other people if I understand the topic. People always mention
                            that I can explain everything and everyone will easily understand It.

                            I have been working for two years in a company that distributes industrial automation  
                            components(IAC), my job is to program controllers, programmable terminals(PT) and other  
                            IAC using an IEC 61131-3 standard. When I am entrusted with a project to develop UX+UI  
                            for PT I put my heart and soul at first into usability and then into design, combining  
                            colors, fonts, indents in the design so that the user has a good impression of using  
                            the equipment we distribute. I do this because I believe it increases company's lead  
                            to compete at the industry market.<br>
                            Worked with Omron PLC's: CP1L, NX1P controllers; Omron and Weintek HMI's: NB-, NA-series panels and cMT-series HMI also.
                            I can easily program any other controllers and panels for woodworking, automatic cutting, sanding, especially greenhouse and ventilation control tasks.
