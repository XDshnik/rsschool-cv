## 3. About me 🤓

I want to become a worthy developer-aka-mentor in a good team, I'm good at communication,  
attentive to what others say, always offer my point of view if I have something to say.   
It's easy to me to teach other people if I understand the topic. People always mention  
that I can explain everything and everyone will easily understand It.

## 4. Skills 💪🏻

C++, Java, SQL and Python on the university level,  
HTML+CSS on a basic level, never touched JavaScript before,  
English on a B2 level.  
I use Photoshop everyday at work because I work a lot with graphic  
elements and they usually need time to make them looking good.  

## 5. Code examples 👨‍💻

The following code snippet is a part of PT's macros which used in one of the industrial  
printing projects. It determines the vacant number when user creats a new recipe item for the  
typography and assigns it to that new item.  
```c
RecipeQuery("SELECT * FROM Cameras", total_row)
if total_row == 1 then 
  free_num = 1
else
  for i = 1 to 128 step 1  
    for j = 0 to total_row step 1  
      RecipeGetData(num, "Cameras.number",j) 
        if num == i then
          break
        end if
      next j
      if j >= total_row then
        free_num = i
        break
      end if
  next i
end if
```

## 6. Experience 🧘‍♂️

I have been working for two years in a company that distributes industrial automation  
components(IAC), my job is to program controllers, programmable terminals(PT) and other  
IAC using an IEC 61131-3 standard. When I am entrusted with a project to develop UX+UI  
for PT I put my heart and soul at first into usability and then into design, combining  
colors, fonts, indents in the design so that the user has a good impression of using  
the equipment we distribute. I do this because I believe it increases company's lead  
to compete at the industry market. For half a year, I regularly worked on site layout  
based on videos from the YouTube channel WAY UP, and had good success. But then I needed  
to find a distribution at which I would work after university graduation, and I am very  
sorry now that I did not get to work as a layout designer for invaluable experience and   
at least for food 🤷🏻‍♂️ 🍜.

## 8. Language 💁🏻‍♂️

I studied hard with English tutor since I was 6 y.o., so now It's easy to me to understand technical  
documentation, watch films in English, discuss any topic with others. Also I attended  
the English Club throughout the year in [Youth Center "Fialta"](https://fialta.org/english/).
